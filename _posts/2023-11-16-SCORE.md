I'm delighted to share my paper here. The initial idea for this paper can be traced back to early 2021, the first draft was completed in October 2021, and it was officially accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) in October 2023. TPAMI is one of the best and most influential journals in the field of artificial intelligence, with an impact factor of 24.314. From developing the initial idea to its final publication, nearly three years have passed. This experience, despite its challenges, has been quite rewarding. Therefore, besides sharing the contents of our paper, I also want to reflect on the whole process. If my journey can offer you some inspiration, feel free to give it a thumbs up, star our github repo, or cite our paper in your future research. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‘» Thank you!

**TLDR**: High-quality uncertainty estimation + The pessimism principle -> Reliable offline reinforcement learning

The Challenging Journey of Publicating The Paper
======


Afterword
======
For those interested in the details of the paper, please refer directly to the main paper and the appendix. The purpose of this article is to review and share the experience. Almost three years have passed. With the end of the pandemic and the acceptance of our paper, it's time to close this chapter on pessimism and embrace a new beginning. During this period, there were moments when I felt I couldn't overcome the challenges. I am very grateful for the support of my friends, collaborators, and teachers. I especially want to thank my wife, who always found ways to help me relax when I was feeling down.

Finally, here's a little something lovely for my dear readers:
