I'm delighted to share my paper with everyone here. The initial idea for this paper can be traced back to early 2021, the first draft was completed in October 2021, and it was officially accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) in October 2023. TPAMI is one of the best and most influential journals in the field of artificial intelligence, with an impact factor of 24.314. From developing the initial idea to its final publication, nearly three years have passed. This experience, despite its challenges, has been quite rewarding. Therefore, besides sharing the contents of our paper here, I also want to reflect on the whole process. If my journey can offer you some inspiration, feel free to give it a thumbs up, leave a star, or cite our paper in your future research. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ‘» Thank you!

**TLDR**: High-quality uncertainty estimation + The pessimism principle -> Reliable offline reinforcement learning
