Learning the representation of categorical data with
hierarchical value coupling relationships is very
challenging but critical for the effective analysis
and learning of such data. This paper proposes a
novel coupled unsupervised categorical data representation
(CURE) framework and its instantiation,
i.e., a coupled data embedding (CDE) method, for
representing categorical data by hierarchical value to-
value cluster coupling learning. Unlike existing
embedding- and similarity-based representation
methods which can capture only a part or none of
these complex couplings, CDE explicitly incorporates
the hierarchical couplings into its embedding
representation. CDE first learns two complementary
feature value couplings which are then used to
cluster values with different granularities. It further
models the couplings in value clusters within
the same granularity and with different granularities
to embed feature values into a new numerical
space with independent dimensions. Substantial
experiments show that CDE significantly outperforms
three popular unsupervised embedding methods
and three state-of-the-art similarity-based representation
methods.
