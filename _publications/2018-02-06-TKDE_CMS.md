Appropriate similarity measures always play a critical role in data analytics, learning and processing. Measuring the intrinsic
similarity of categorical data for unsupervised learning has not been substantially addressed, and even less effort has been made for
the similarity analysis of categorical data that is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this work, a Coupled Metric
Similarity (CMS) is defined for unsupervised learning which flexibly captures the value-to-attribute-to-object heterogeneous coupling
relationships. CMS learns the similarities in terms of intrinsic heterogeneous intra- and inter-attribute couplings and attribute-to-object
couplings in categorical data. The CMS validity is guaranteed by satisfying metric properties and conditions, and CMS can flexibly
adapt to IID to non-IID data. CMS is incorporated into spectral clustering and k-modes clustering and compared with relevant
state-of-the-art similarity measures that are not necessarily metrics. The experimental results and theoretical analysis show the CMS
effectiveness of capturing independent and coupled data characteristics, which significantly outperforms other similarity measures on
most datasets.
