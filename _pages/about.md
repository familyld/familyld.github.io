I am a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/chengqi.zhang) and [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang). Before joining UTS, I was a visiting scholar at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working with [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang) and [Prof. Xuan Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/songxuan.html). I received my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2020 and 2017 respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](http://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn).

Research
========

My current research focuses on causal reinforcement learning (RL),  an emerging subfield of RL that incorporates prior knowledge and assumptions to analyze the underlying causal mechanisms of actions and their consequences. By harnessing causal relationships, RL agents gain insights into complex environments and tasks, facilitating informed decision-making. *If you share my enthusiasm for this exciting topic and are interested in collaboration or exploring research ideas, please feel free to [reach out to me](zhi-hong.deng@student.uts.edu.au)ÔºÅ*  üòâ

News
=======

* We just present a tutorial on causal reinforcement learning at [ADMA 2023](https://adma2023.uqcloud.net/index.html). Check the [PPT](https://2wildkids.com/files/ADMA2023-Tutorial-CausalRL-ZhihongDeng.pdf) here.
