I am a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/chengqi.zhang) and [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang). Before joining UTS, I was a visiting scholar at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working with [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang) and [Prof. Xuan Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/songxuan.html). I received my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2020 and 2017 respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](http://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn).

Research
========

My current research interests center on the design of practical reinforcement learning algorithms. Among various research topics, I am particularly interested in offline reinforcement learning and causal reinforcement learning. Also, I am actively looking for opportunities to use these algorithms to solve real-world decision-making problems, e.g., personalized recommendations.

News
=======
* One new paper on offline RL is on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12468) now.
* One paper on session-based recommender systems has been submitted to TNNLS (**SCI Q1**) for the second round of review.
* One paper on deep learning-based recommender systems has been accepted by AAAI 2019 (**Oral**).
* Our paper on serendipitous recommendation was accepted by TCYB (**SCI Q1**).
