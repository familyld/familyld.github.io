I am a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/chengqi.zhang) and [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang). Before joining UTS, I was a visiting scholar at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working with [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang) and [Prof. Xuan Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/songxuan.html). I received my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2020 and 2017 respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](http://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn). 

My current research focuses on causal reinforcement learning (RL), an emerging research field that incorporates prior knowledge and assumptions about causal relationships into the RL framework, empowering agents to better comprehend the world. By harnessing causal relationships, agents gain insights into complex environments and tasks, facilitating informed decision-making. Ultimately, the goal of my research is to advance the progress of next-generation AI agents towards human-level intelligence with robustness, fairness, and interpretability. *If you are also passionate about this field and are interested in potential collaborations or discussing research ideas, please feel free to [reach out to me](zhi-hong.deng@student.uts.edu.au)ÔºÅ*  üòâ

**I am currently seeking postdoctoral positions or roles as a research scientist/engineer in related fields. If you have any opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you!**
