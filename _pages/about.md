I am a graduate student with the School of Data and Computer Science (SDCS), Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). I got my Bachalor Degree at SYSU in 2017. [[Visit my CV]](http://familyld.github.io/files/CV_Zhi-HongDeng.pdf)

Research
========

My current research interest is mainly on using deep learning techniques to solve recommendation and other graph-based problems. I am also highly interested in GANs, multi-agent reinforcement learning and their application on various areas.

News

* One papers on recommender systems have been accepted by AAAI 2019 (**Oral**).
* Our paper on serendipitous recommendation was accepted by TCYB (**SCI Q1**).
