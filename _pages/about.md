I am a visiting scholar at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), working with [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang) and [Prof. Xuan Song](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/songxuan.html). In 2021, I will join the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) as a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Chengqi Zhang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/chengqi.zhang) and [Dr Jing Jiang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/jing.jiang). I received my Master's Degree and Bachelor's Degree from the School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2017 and 2013 respectively, under the supervision of [Prof. Chang-Dong Wang](http://www.scholat.com/changdongwang.cn).

Research
========

My current research interest is mainly on solving real-world challenges of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), especially offline reinforcement learning. I am also highly interested in the application of DRL in various areas, e.g., recommender systems and dialog systems. 

News
=======
* One papers on deep learning-based recommender systems have been accepted by AAAI 2019 (**Oral**).
* Our paper on serendipitous recommendation was accepted by TCYB (**SCI Q1**).
