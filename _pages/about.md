Research
========

My current research interest is mainly on solving real-world challenges of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), especially offline reinforcement learning. I am also highly interested in the application of DRL in various areas, e.g., recommender systems and dialog systems. 

News

* One papers on deep learning-based recommender systems have been accepted by AAAI 2019 (**Oral**).
* Our paper on serendipitous recommendation was accepted by TCYB (**SCI Q1**).
